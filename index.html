                    <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
                    <p>Did you know that nearly 37% of Americans recently rated their mental health as fair or poor? Additionally, around 66% of Americans are anxious about their health, and 65% worry about paying bills or expenses. Stress, anxiety, and depression can lead to physical symptoms if not addressed.</p>
                    <p>Positive thinking has been shown to significantly benefit mental health, particularly in managing ADHD. Studies suggest fostering a positive mindset can improve focus, reduce symptoms, and enhance overall well-being.</p>
                    <p>Repeatt is here to help you overcome ADHD through positive thinking, providing the tools and strategies to foster a healthier mindset.</p>
